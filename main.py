# so there are 2 types of machine learning
# 1 statistical ML and deep learning
# machine learning model is an equation or mathematical formulae that is derived from the operation , or comparison
# or calculation between inputs and outputs from the large dataset
# machine learning the part of computer science that trains the computer program on the datas so that
# this program can make predictions without explicit programming.

# there are two types of model training in statistical ML
# classication and regression

# in classification, the program classifies the output into different categories
# there are binary and multiclass classification
# binary classification is of two classes
# multiclass classification is of multiple types

# in regression, the program just provides the numerical output based on the input data



# neural networks
# A neural network is a layered model made of interconnected neurons that learn complex patterns in data through weighted mathematical operations.
